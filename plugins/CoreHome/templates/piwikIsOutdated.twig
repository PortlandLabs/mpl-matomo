            <h1>Your Piwik is outdated and insecure. Upgrade now to Matomo 3, the most efficient and secure Matomo version</h1>
            <p>You are using Piwik 2 which is no longer supported since December 2017. This means your Piwik will no longer receive any updates or security fixes and therefore this version is considered insecure.</p>

            <h2>Piwik is now Matomo</h2>
            <p>
                You may be surprised, but no stress, take a deep breath, it is only our name that changed and nothing else.
                In January 2018 we have renamed <strong>Piwik to Matomo</strong>. <a href="https://matomo.org/blog/2018/01/piwik-is-now-matomo">Learn more</a>
            </p>

            <h2>What is new in Matomo 3?</h2>

                In December 2016, we have released <a href="https://matomo.org/changelog/piwik-3-0-0/">Piwik 3.0</a> which brings heaps of awesome new features, a new improved user interface, and lots of performance and security improvements.
                Since then, many <a href="https://matomo.org/changelog/">new major updates have been released</a> that further improve the security and performance and bring new features such as a GDPR manager, a revamped user management, cross domain tracking, and hundreds of other new features.
